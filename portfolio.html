          <h3>A Man For All Seasons</h3>
          <p>We've all been in situations we later regretted. This is one of Drew's. The Peak District looked
          picturesque
          on TV. It looked like a place a man could find himself. Come to terms with the disappointments in his life
          whilst being reminded that there is still beauty in the world. "Come and enjoy the view," they said.
          This is why Drew hates TV.

          <h3>An Ongoing Project</h3>
          <p>This is a project Drew has been working on for some time. It takes a lot of commitment and his family have had to make sacrifices to support it.
          But Drew is a believer; he thinks more people should contribute to this sort of thing. He says it has exciting applications.

          <h3>A Big House</h3>
          <p>This is a big house. The sort of house many peoople think they would like to live in. It is symbolic of Drew's success and ambition that he doesn't live here. But we can all have our dreams.
          Drew should think about the potential heating bills. He probably won't.
