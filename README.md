# My Portfolio##DescriptionThis portfolio represents the best of my work completed during the Birmingham University Bootcamp. It is intended to give an overview of the skills I have gained and the progress I have made so far. As such, it will be updated regularly during the course. As we are currently on Week 10 of a 24 week programme, the content is necessarily limited, and - in all honesty - does not include my worst attempts! But hopefully, by the end of the course, it should give a pretty good idea of my skills as a coder.The deployed app can be seen here: https://drewbassett24.github.io/Portfolio/## Screenshots of some of my apps in action.![WorkSchedulerScreenshot1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73472116/107391429-976b0280-6af0-11eb-8ee0-d51d89899c6c.jpg)![WorkSchedulerScreenshot2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73472116/107391431-98039900-6af0-11eb-9f76-af9b7e69ae4e.jpg)![PassGenScreenshot1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73472116/107391432-98039900-6af0-11eb-87c6-1f84e07a1741.jpg)![PassGenScreenshot2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73472116/107391434-989c2f80-6af0-11eb-82d9-cd00621855e1.jpg)## UsageClearly, the main use of this portfolio is show of my current capabilities to prospective employers and to give an update to those interested in my progress.## Technology EmployedSo far, this portfolio has been built entirely from HTML and Bootstrap. That could change as i update it.## Future DevelopmentObviously, I'd like this portfolio to grow as I achieve more in coding, to reflect my ongoing progress. I'd also like to make it more engaging, as I personally feel its a bit flat. I'd like to include more referenc to life outiside of Bootcamp, as well, as, increasingly, I think employers are interested in what employees bring to the workplace beyond just job-related skills (crucial as they may be), such as interpersonal skills and personal interests.I'd like to integrate my CV to a greater degree, as well. It seems anomalous to include a 'flat' PDF in something like this, especially when the goal of nearly all our work as coders is to make information engaging.## Challenges and Learning.I don't mind admitting that the first time I attempted this portfolio, it was a disaster. It wouldn't load onto the page the way I wanted, it wasn't reponsive. it was awful. I was always determined to come back and do it again. And whatever state you currently find it it, it still isn't finished. It will be finished when I retire. Possibly.
