          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking the time to look at my page.</p>
          <p>I'm fifty years old and both relocating to Northern Ireland and retraining. I've been a teacher for over
            twenty years, first teaching TEFL in Thailand and Columbia, then teaching ESOL (English for Speakers of
            Other Languages) in Birmingham and finally teaching Literature and Language in Secondary School.
            Most of those switches have seen mye outside my comfort zone and
            I like that. It stops you fossilising in a rut of your own making.
            In FE, I had excellent training in target-setting, challenging yourself, problem-solving and basically
            embracing the 'Discomfort Zone' despite all your instincts to do otherwise.
            In Secondary School I learned what it was like to go from Assistant Principle to the bottom rung of the
            ladder and start over.
            I love teaching, but for personal reasons, it is time to do something new. I also have a cat, called PB.
            Family members disagree over what it stands for, but if I tell you that for me, it means Personal Business,
            those in the know will get the reference.
          </p>
          <p>I also like walking, talking, reading, writing, drawing, watching (good) movies and The Expanse and
            American Gods and good food. I'm a vegetarian (most of the time...) and I like real ale and single malt
            whiskey
            in moderation. And people. I like people.</p>
